## Tutorial ##

This is a step-by-step guide to setting up a minimal ForgeRock OpenAM solution using Docker, and using it to authenticate and authorise access to resources.

NOTE: These were notes I took while learning about the product and how it could be used to solve the particular problems I wanted to solve - it isn't intended to be comprehensive or accurate. For formal documentation, please refer to the online documentation:
